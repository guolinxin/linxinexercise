# Elsevier Coding Exercise

Please write a console application that simulates a simple supermarket checkout. It needs to meet the following requirements:

* The application should read a list of items and prices from a file (the file format is up to you, e.g. csv, json etc). Please include an example input file.

* From the list of items and prices, the application should calculate the total price, including any discounts.

* Discounts are calculated based on rules defined in the system, and should be applied automatically. The following types of discount should be calculated:

* A fixed percentage off an item (e.g.. 50% off)

* Buy 3 items of a type, get the cheapest free (e.g. buy three boxes of cereal, get the cheapest free)

* Buy 2 identical items receive a promotional price( e.g. buy 2 for Â£2)

* The application should output the total price of the items, a list of the items bought and any special offers applied.

* It should be easy to add more special offer rules

* The application should be appropriately tested

* A readme file should be included to explain project usage, and how to add more special offers.

We expect you to take 2-4 hours on this exercise. Please prioritise producing a running console application over implementing all the requirements.

Please provide your completed code as a zip file to your contact.
